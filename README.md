# Pokemon RBY Practice ROM Patcher

A tool used to create ROMs that can load save states from within the game itself.

GUI is not pretty, but it should be functional for now.

Original patcher made by stringflow (most of this logic is plagiarized)

Save state ROMs (and patches) made by gifvex

## Usage

Start by loading a vanilla Red, Blue or Yellow ROM into the program when prompted.
You can then begin adding save states to the ROM via the "Add State" button and they will appear on the left.
The state name will default to the file name, and you can rename the selected state with the "Rename State" button.

The list on the left can also be reordered via click and drag.

If you are modifying an existing save state ROM, you can use the "Open ROM..." button in the bottom to load those states into this program.

When you are done, you can hit "Save As..." to finish your newly created save state ROM.

Once you open the ROM, you can press Down + B + Select to access the save state menu.
